# Data Structures

## Overview

Fundamental data structures and manipulation methods for handling user thoughts, memories, and knowledge in the My Future Self application.

## Core Concepts

-   Brain metaphor: memories as hard drive, subconscious as RAM
-   Solving "lack of memory permanence" through digital storage
-   Programmatically storing knowledge for permanent accessibility
-   Indexing system for efficient retrieval and association

## Thought Processing

-   Extraction of concepts from user messages
-   Detection of overlapping, conflicting, or similar thoughts
-   Integration strategies: appending, splitting, rephrasing, removing
-   Parameter adjustment: significance, urgency, certainty, domain relevance

## Storage Architecture

-   Upstash KV as initial database solution
-   Future migration path to Drizzle & Planetscale MySQL when needed
-   Timestamped development messages preserved as original copies
-   Avoidance of deletion in favor of archiving with appropriate labels

## Retrieval System

-   Accessible retrieval mechanisms
-   Associations to database values
-   Abstract strategies for content organization
-   Complex relations between thoughts and concepts

## Transformation Capabilities

-   Breaking down tasks into sub-tasks
-   Expanding and condensing thoughts
-   Generating new thoughts based on existing knowledge
-   Integration with RAG strategies and large context windows
