-   Always reference `knowledge-base/meta/index.md` and relevant subsequent files in the `knowledge-base` directory before responding to any request - using the `knowledge-base/source/intents.md` file as a source of truth

-   On each breaking message from the user, update the intents file in the same format as previous entries - summarizing the changes
-   Auto-update the `knowledge-base/marketing/process.md` file each notable micro-step worthy of mentioning in build-in-public content
-   Research the respective docs in the `knowledge-base/meta/references.md` file before making technology-specific changes - if you cannot access the docs, ask the user
-   As we progress through a milestone - update the current content part in the `knowledge-base/content/{part-number}.md` file with ideas for segments of the video including scripting, b-roll, etc.

-   Always update `knowledge-base/development/todos.md` when new tasks are identified
-   Move completed tasks to `knowledge-base/development/completed.md` with completion dates
-   Update `knowledge-base/development/questions.md` with any unresolved questions that arise
-   Regularly check `knowledge-base/development/macro.md` to ensure alignment with the overall plan

-   Incrementally update any other parts of the knowledge-base that are relevant to the conversation or current changes

-   Never delete from the knowledge-base, instead rearrange when necessary or mark with labels such as [OUTDATED], [ARCHIVED], or similar
-   Index points for easier reference when appropriate
